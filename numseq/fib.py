# Part B: fib
# Within the numseq package, create a module named fib.py.
# Within the fib module, define a single function, fib(n),
# that returns the nth Fibonacci number.
# The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence are
# [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...]
# Make sure that your fib(n) function correctly handles
# values of n <= 0. If you choose to implement fib(n)
# as a recursive function, your code will have problems
# if it does not handle valus of n <= 0.
